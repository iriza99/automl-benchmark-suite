# automl-benchmark-suite
This repository contains the code used to run individual AutoML tools for benchmarking purposes across different tasks (classification and regression) and data types (tabular, text, and image). Each AutoML platform is organized in a separate folder, including scripts and configurations used to generate the reported performance metrics.
